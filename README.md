RouterStats-TP-Link
===================

Program to display statistics on the use of the bandwidth of each device connected to the network.
Only works on the TP-Link routers, because the program uses its API.

Basic program, but that allowed me to discover the basics of C# and Visual Studio.
So it has a lot of minor bugs (error if not a TP-Link router, inappropriate display if a lot of devices, ...).

Binary : /RouterStats/bin/Release/RouterStats.exe
